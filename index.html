            <p>
                I'm a Data Scientist/Software Engineer with a background in Mathematics and Physics. I've been working in the <a href="https://qm-rim.org/">Risk and Information Management</a> (RIM) Group and <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/deri/">Digital Environment Research Group</a> (DERI). Here we work on Bayesian Networks and Bayesian Methods in the context of decision support. We collaborate with healthcare professionals from Barts Health NHS Trust with the aim of improving decision making within medical settings. You can check out our projects <a href="http://newton.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/">here</a>.

            <p>
                I also have wider interests in Mathematics, Physics, Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and Web Development. You can find published papers on my <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=L8Q9mhQAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar page</a>. I also have various coding projects at various stages of completion on my <a href="https://github.com/cjoyneruk">Github</a>.
